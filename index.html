                    <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                        As the lead architect and administrator, I designed, implemented, and maintained a robust enterprise spatial data
                        warehouse built on SQL Server, housing over 100 geodatabases supporting statewide GIS operations. The project
                        streamlined spatial data integration, access, and governance across multiple business units. Through a combination
                        of custom ETL scripts, automated workflows, and metadata standards, the warehouse provided centralized,
                        high-performance access to critical geospatial datasets used in web mapping, analysis, and reporting tools across
                        the organization.

                    As the lead developer, I designed and executed a data-driven project to analyze traffic accidents in construction work zones across Kentucky.
                    The project integrates crash data from the Kentucky State Police Collision Data portal with roadway characteristics from the Kentucky
                    Transportation Cabinet’s API to provide a more accurate and comprehensive view of each incident. The primary objective was to explore
                    new data visualization techniques outside traditional GIS software while uncovering patterns and contributing factors to improve roadway
                    safety in high-risk zones.</p>
